# VIP-001: DID system

This VIP defines the DID system used by Voty Protocol.

## Requirements

The DID system `MUST` meet the following requirements:

- Account name should ends with a suffix or a fixed set of suffixes.
- The suffix must be uniq in all registered DID systems (First come, first served).
- Stores data on blockchains registered in [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- Resolves to a certain blockchain wallet address with given `coin_type` and `block_height`.
