# VIP-001: Registered DIDs

The DID system `MUST` meet the following requirements:

- Account name should ends with a suffix or a fixed list of suffixes.
- The suffix must be uniq in all registered DID systems (First come, first served).
- Stores data on blockchains registered in [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- Resolves to a certain blockchain wallet address with a given block height.

| DID system                 | Suffix(es) | Resolving role |
| :------------------------- | :--------- | -------------- |
| [bit](http://did.id/)      | `.bit`     | manager        |
| [ens](http://ens.domains/) | `.eth`     | controller     |
