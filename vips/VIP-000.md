# VIP-000: Basic concepts

This VIP defines the basic concepts.

## User

1 DID = 1 User

> DID stands for Decentralized Identifier

Each software `MAY` choose what kind of DID systems they want to support.

The DID system `MUST` meet the following requirements:

- Has a suffix with a dot.
- Stores data on blockchains registered in [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- Can be resolved to a blockchain wallet address with a given block height.

## Document

There are 3 types of document stores on the Arweave:

- **Organization**: a hub for all related proposals
- **Proposal**: describes the issue of a vote
- **Vote**: choice(s) of a proposal

## Signature

Every type of document contains a field called `signature`:

```ts
{
  ...,
  signature: {
    did: string // account name
    snapshot: string // blockchain height
    coin_type: number // SLIP-0044 coin_type
    address: string // resolved address
    data: string // base64 string of signature
  }
}
```
