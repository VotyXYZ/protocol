# VIP-000: Basic concepts

This VIP defines the basic concepts.

## User

1 DID = 1 User

> DID stand for Decentralized Identifier

Each software `MAY` choose what kind of DID systems they want to support.

The DID system `MUST` meet the following requirements:

- Account name should ends with a suffix or a fixed list of suffixes.
- The suffix must be uniq in all registered DID systems (First come, first served).
- Stores data on blockchains registered in [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- Resolves to a certain blockchain wallet address with a given block height.

## Document

There are 3 types of document:

- **Organization**: a hub for all related proposals
- **Proposal**: describes the issue of a vote
- **Vote**: choice(s) of a proposal

All of the documents `MUST` meet the following requirements:

- Publicly accessible.
- Immutable.
- Has a timestamp provided by storage provider.

## Signature

Every type of document contains a field called `signature`:

```ts
{
  ...,
  signature: {
    did: string // account name
    snapshot: string // blockchain height
    coin_type: number // SLIP-0044 coin_type
    address: string // resolved blockchain wallet address
    data: string // base64 string of signature
  }
}
```

Here is a pseudo code shows how `signature.data` is calculated:

```ts
function sign_document({ signature, ...document }) {
  const hash = to_hex(sha_256(json_stringify(document)));
  const message = `You are signing for Voty Protocol.\n\nhash: 0x${hash}`;
  return to_base64(user_sign(message));
}
```
