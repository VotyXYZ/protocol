# VIP-000: Basic concepts

This VIP defines the basic concepts of Voty Protocol.

## DID

DID is the primitive unit of proposing ant voting.

> DID stand for Decentralized Identity

Software `MAY` choose what kinds of DID systems they want to support.

All supported DID systems are registered in [VIP-001](/vips/VIP-001.md).

## Document

There are 3 types of Document in JSON format:

- **Community**: a hub for all related Proposals.

  ```ts
  type Community = {
    name: string;
    groups: {
      name: string;
    }[];
  };
  ```

- **Proposal**: describes the issue of a Vote.

  ```ts
  type Proposal = {
    community: string; // belongs to which Community
    group: number; // index of Community's group array
    title: string;
    options: string[]; // voting options, must be unique
  };
  ```

- **Vote**: voter's decision.

  ```ts
  type Vote = {
    proposal: string; // belongs to which Proposal
    choice: string; // choice of voter
  };
  ```

All of the Documents `MUST` be stored in a storage.

```ts
type Document = Community | Proposal | Vote;
```

Software `MAY` choose what kinds of storage providers they want to support.

All supported storage providers are registered in [VIP-002](/vips/VIP-002.md).

## Authorization

Voty Protocol uses cryptographic proofs to verify the authorship of Document.

Every type of Document contains a field called `author`:

```ts
type Author = {
  did: string; // DID name
  coin_type: number; // SLIP-0044 coin_type of a blockchain
  snapshot: string; // block_height of blockchain
  address: string; // resolved blockchain wallet address
  proof: string; // signature or something else
};

type Authorized<T extends Document> = T & {
  author: Author;
};
```

A DID `MUST` be resolved to a certain wallet address with given `coin_type` and `block_height`. Then we can use the resolved wallet to sign and verify proof.

```
     coin_type + block_height
DID -------- resolve --------> wallet address
```

All supported proof formats are registered in [VIP-003](/vips/VIP-003.md).
