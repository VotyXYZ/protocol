# VIP-000: Basic concepts

This VIP defines the basic concepts.

## User

1 DID = 1 User

> DID stand for Decentralized Identifier

Each software `MAY` choose what kinds of DID systems they want to support.

The DID system `MUST` meet the following requirements:

- Account name should ends with a suffix or a fixed list of suffixes.
- The suffix must be uniq in all registered DID systems (First come, first served).
- Stores data on blockchains registered in [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
- Resolves to a certain blockchain wallet address with a given block height.

## Document

There are 3 types of document in JSON format:

- **Organization**: a hub for all related proposals

  ```ts
  {
    title: string;
    body: string;
  }
  ```

- **Proposal**: describes the issue of a vote

  ```ts
  {
    organization: string; // the organization belongs to
    title: string;
    body: string;
    choices: string[]; // voting options
    snapshots: { [coin_type: string]: string }; // records of blockchain height
  }
  ```

- **Vote**: choice(s) of a proposal

  ```ts
  {
    proposal: string; // the proposal belongs to
    title: string;
    body: string;
    choice: string; // choice of user
    power: string; // voting power of user
  }
  ```

All of the documents `MUST` be stored in a storage.

## Signature

Every type of document contains a field called `signature`:

```ts
{
  ...,
  signature: {
    did: string // DID name
    snapshot: string // blockchain height
    coin_type: number // SLIP-0044 coin_type
    address: string // resolved blockchain wallet address
    data: string // base64 string of signature
  }
}
```

Here is a piece of pseudo code shows how `signature.data` is calculated:

```ts
function sign_document({ signature, ...document }) {
  const hash = to_hex(sha_256(json_stringify(document)));
  const message = `You are signing for Voty Protocol.\n\nhash: 0x${hash}`;
  return to_base64(user_sign(message));
}
```

## Storage

Each software `MAY` choose what kinds of storage providers they want to use.

The storage provider `MUST` meet the following requirements:

- Immutable, document can't be modified once created.
- Publicly accessible by all users and softwares.
- Provides a creation timestamp for each document.
- Provides a uniq ID/key/hash for each document.
