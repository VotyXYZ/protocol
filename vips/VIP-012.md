# VIP-012: Revoke Document

This VIP defines a rule to revoke previous Document.

```ts
type Revocable<T extends Document> = T & {
  revocable_before: number;
};
```

```ts
type Revoke = {
  revoked: string; // Document Permalink
  author: Author;
};
```

The revoke is valid only if it's on-chain confirmation timestamp is before Document's `revocable_before`, and the `author` of Revoke is as same as Document's `author`.
