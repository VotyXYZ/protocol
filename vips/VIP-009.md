# VIP-009: Revoke document

This VIP defines a rule to revoke previous documents.

```ts
type Revocable<T extends Document> = T & {
  revocable_before: number;
};
```

```ts
type Revoke = {
  id: string; // document URI
  revoker: Author;
};
```

The revoke is valid only if it's timestamp is before document's revocable_before, and the revoker is as same as document's author.
