# VIP-007: Dynamic options

This VIP defines a way to add options to proposal after creation.

Software `MAY` choose if they want to support this feature or not.

Firstly we set a proposal's options to empty array:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "options": []
}
```

Then we add a field to community's group to identify the set of users who have ability to add option.

```ts
type Community = {
  // ...
  groups: {
    // ...
    add_option_rights?: ProposalRightsSets;
  }[];
};
```

The data structure of add_option_rights is as same as proposal_rights.

Also, we need to add a timing called "adding_option":

```ts
type Community = {
  // ...
  groups: {
    // ...
    timing: {
      // ...
      adding_option?: number;
    };
  }[];
};
```

Finally, we define the option:

```ts
type Option = {
  proposal: string; // belongs to which proposal
  title: string;
  author: Author;
};
```

When users voting, they are actually selecting the URI of the option document instead of string in options array.
