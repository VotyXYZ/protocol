# VIP-007: Dynamic choices

This VIP describes a way to add choice options to proposal after creation.

Software `MAY` choose if they want to support this feature or not.

Firstly we set a proposal's choices to empty array:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "choices": []
}
```

Then we add a field to community's group to identify the set of users who have ability to append choice.

```ts
type Community = {
  // ...
  groups: {
    // ...
    appending_choice?: ProposalRightsSets;
  }[];
};
```

The data structure of appending_choice is as same as proposal_rights.

Also, we need to add a timing called "proposing":

```ts
type Community = {
  // ...
  groups: {
    // ...
    timing: {
      // ...
      proposing?: number;
    };
  }[];
};
```

Finally, we define the choice:

```ts
type Choice = {
  proposal: string; // belongs to which proposal
  title: string;
};
```

When users are voting, they choice the URI of choice document instead of string in choices array.
