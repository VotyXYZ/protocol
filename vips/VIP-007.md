# VIP-007: Voting type

This VIP defines voting type of Proposal.

First we need to add field to Proposal:

```ts
type Proposal = {
  // ...
  voting_type: "single" | "multiple" | "weighted";
};
```

This field tells voters how to format the choice of Vote.

## Choice format

Different voting types has different choice format.

The formats of choice are all **stringified json**.

Software `MAY` choose what kinds of voting types they want to support.

For example we have a Proposal like this:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "options": ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David"] // options are unique strings.
}
```

Here are the choice format and voting power calculating rules of voting types:

### Single

```jsonc
{
  "choice": "\"Bob\"" // single string. (Don't forget the double quote.)
}
```

In this case, "Bob" got all voting power from the voter.

### Multiple

```jsonc
{
  "choice": "[\"Alice\", \"Carol\", \"David\"]" // array of string.
}
```

In this case, everyone of "Alice", "Carol" and "David" got 1/3 of voting power from the voter.

### Weighted

```jsonc
{
  "choice": "{ \"Alice\": 0.2, \"Bob\": 0.3, \"Carol\": 0.5 }"
  // records of string and relative weight. Sum of relative weights must less or equal than 1.
}
```

In this case, "Alice" got 1/5, "Bob" got 3/10 and "Carol" got 1/2 of voting power from the voter.
