# VIP-003: Entry to organization

This VIP describes a way to provide a human-readable entry to organization.

Since organization is a document stored in a storage provider, the precise way to access a organization is the URI defined in [VIP-002](/vips/VIP-002.md).

The URI is not human-readable. To resolve the problem, we treat a single organization's URI as a git commit hash, we can create a `HEAD` to point to the current organization URI.

Many DID systems can be used as a self-sovereign data container. The `HEAD` point can be stored there.

## Registered organization entries

To register a DID system as organization entry, you must first register in [VIP-001](/vips/VIP-001.md).
