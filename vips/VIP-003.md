# VIP-003: Entry to community

This VIP describes a way to provide a human-readable entry to community.

Since community is a document stored in a storage provider, the precise way to access a community is the Permalink defined in [VIP-002](/vips/VIP-002.md).

The Permalink is not human-readable. To resolve the problem, we treat a single community's Permalink as a git commit hash, we can create a `HEAD` to point to the current community Permalink.

Many DID systems can be used as a self-sovereign data container. The `HEAD` point can be stored there.

Software `MAY` choose what kinds of DID systems they want to use as community entry.

## Registered community entries

To register a DID system as community entry, you must first register in [VIP-001](/vips/VIP-001.md).
