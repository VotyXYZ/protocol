# VIP-003: Entry to the Community

This VIP describes a way to provide a human-readable entry to Community.

Since Community is a Document stored in a storage provider, the precise way to access a Community is the Permalink defined in [VIP-002](/vips/VIP-002.md).

The Permalink is not human-readable. To resolve the problem, we treat a single Community's Permalink as a git commit hash, we can create a pointer to the current Community Permalink.

Many DID systems can be used as a self-sovereign data container. The pointer can be stored there.

Software `MAY` choose what kinds of DID systems they want to use as Community entry.

## Registered Community entries

To register a DID system as Community entry, you must first register in [VIP-001](/vips/VIP-001.md).
