# Voty Protocol

What is Voty Protocol?

- A decentralized permissionless voting system designed for DAOs.
- Whole-process transparency and immutable (based on Arweave).

## VIPs

VIPs stand for Voty Implementation Possibilities. They exist to document what `MUST`, what `SHOULD` and what `MAY` be implemented by Voty-compatible software.
